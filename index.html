                <p><strong>Dr.M.A.Atmanand</strong> has 34 years of experience in field of ocean technology and retired
                    as the Director of National Institute of Ocean Technology Chennai.
                    He is currently working as a Visiting Professor in Indian Institute of Technology, Madras - Chennai.
                    He is elected as member of Society for Underwater Technology (SUT) Council. He is member of the
                    Executive Planning Group for preparation of UN Decade of Ocean Science for sustainable development
                    [2012-2030] of Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO. He was elected as Chair
                    of Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Regional Committee for the
                    Central Indian Ocean (IOCINDIO) of IOC, UNESCO
                    [2016-2021]. </p><br>
                <p>An Instrumentation and Control
                    Engineer by profession, he took his undergraduate degree from University of Calicut, Master’s
                    and doctorate degrees from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India. He has done pioneering
                    work in the area of deep sea technologies in India. He led a team of Engineers for the design and
                    development of underwater crawler for deep sea operation. He and his team developed the in-situ soil
                    tester which was tested at a depth of 5200 m in the Central Indian Ocean Basin. Dr. Atmanand has
                    taken this
                    challenge further to design and implement a work class Remotely Operable Vehicle (ROV) that can be
                    used for assisting the mining operations, gas hydrates site for validation of presence of methane,
                    pipeline inspection etc. This was later tested at a depth of 5289 m water depth. It was under his
                    supervision that India's first Polar under water mooring observatory and Polar Remotely Operable
                    Vehicle (PROV) was developed and tested. The mooring was established at Kongsfjorden in Arctic
                    region. The Polar ROV was tested successfully at the Priyadarshini lake at Antarctica. He has also
                    guided various indigenization programmes for Ocean observation and under water systems. His areas of
                    interest include</p><br>
