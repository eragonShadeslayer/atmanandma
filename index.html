                    <p><strong>Dr.M.A.Atmanand</strong> has 40 years of experience in the field of ocean technology and
                        retired as the Director of the National Institute of Ocean Technology Chennai.He is a Visiting
                        Professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras - Chennai. He is nominated as Chair of
                        the Marine Systems Panel, Naval Research Board, Defence Research and Development Organisation
                        (DRDO), Govt. of India. He is the Governor's nominee to the Planning board of Bharathidasan
                        University. He is a former member of the Executive Planning Group and a former member of the
                        Interim Decade Advisory Board for the preparation of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for
                        Sustainable Development [2012-2030] of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of
                        UNESCO. He was elected as Chair of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Regional
                        Committee for the Central Indian Ocean (IOCINDIO) of IOC, UNESCO [2016-2021].
                    </p><br>
                    <p>An Instrumentation and Control
                        Engineer by profession, he took his undergraduate degree from University of Calicut, Master’s
                        and doctorate degrees from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India. He has presently
                        coined specific courses based on his vast experience in Ocean technology and is sharing the same
                        with the students. Previously, he has done pioneering work in the area of deep-sea technologies
                        in India.
                        He led a team of Engineers for the design and development of underwater crawler for deep sea
                        operation. He and his team developed the in-situ soil tester which was tested at a depth of 5200
                        m in the Central Indian Ocean Basin. Dr. Atmanand has taken this challenge further to design and
                        implement a work class Remotely Operable Vehicle (ROV) that can be used for assisting the mining
                        operations, gas hydrates site for validation of presence of methane, pipeline inspection etc.
                        This was later tested at a depth of 5289 m water depth. It was under his supervision that
                        India's first Polar under water mooring observatory and Polar Remotely Operable Vehicle (PROV)
                        was developed and tested. The mooring was established at Kongsfjorden in Arctic region. The
                        Polar ROV was tested successfully at the Priyadarshini lake at Antarctica. He has also guided
                        various indigenization programmes for Ocean observation and under water systems. His areas of
                        interest include</p><br>
