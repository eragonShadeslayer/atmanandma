                <h2>Major Achievements</h2><br>
                <ul style="list-style-image: url(images/bullet_9.png)">
                    <li><p>Setting up of an impulse turbine based wave energy converter as part of wave energy project
                        at Vizhinjam, Kerala. Data collection and analysis of the performance of flipping and fixed
                        guide vane impulse turbine used for energy conversion.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Involved with the 1 MW floating Ocean Thermal Energy conversion project. Data analysis of
                        various intermediate tests like open cycle ammonia test etc. </p></li>
                    <li><p>Initiated activities related to deep sea mining by participating in the design and
                        development of a crawler for pumping of sand slurry from a depth of 500m after equipping the ORV
                        SagarKanya with a Dynamic Positioning (DP) and Launching and Retrieval system (LARS). </p></li>
                    <li><p>Technology transfer to Industry was done for Remotely Operable Vehicles, wave powered data
                        buoy, Autonomous underwater profiling drifter, Robo coastal observer, Drifter based on INSAT
                        communication, Expandable CTD profiler etc</p></li>
                    <li><p>The mining machine was augmented with Collector and Crusher and tested at 500 m depth by
                        laying artificial nodules on the ocean floor. A Remotely Operated Subsea Artificial Nodule
                        Laying System was developed for creating a small mine site similar to that of the one in Central
                        Indian Ocean Basin (CIOB). Artificial nodules were prepared with properties (density, hardness
                        and aggregate impact test value) close to that of manganese nodules. </p></li>
                    <li><p>To meet the grand challenges of designing the underwater mining system at a depth of 6000m,
                        it was required to develop an underwater in-situ soil property measuring system andDesign,
                        implement and test the system in the deep sea. The above was successfully designed, fabricated
                        and tested in the Central Indian Ocean basin at a depth of 5462m.</p></li>
                    <li><p>India’s first Polar Remotely Operable Vehicle (PROV) was developed and tested. The Polar ROV
                        was tested successfully at the Priyadarshinilake at Antarctica. Underwater videos were taken for
                        the first time in the country with this vehicle.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Played a major role in design and implementation of a work class Remotely Operable Vehicle
                        (ROV) – again first for the country – that can be used for assisting the mining operations, gas
                        hydrates site for validation of presence of methane, pipeline inspection etc.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Setting up of low temperature thermal desalination plants in the islands of Agatti, Minicoy
                        and Kalpeni in the Lakshadweep group of islands in Arabian Sea successfully.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Brought to rail the Ocean observation buoy system with 12 buoys always available in the
                        Indian seas to collect atmospheric and sub surface data, which gets disseminated to Indian
                        National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), thereby to Indian Meteorological
                        Department (IMD). One of the reasons for improvement in Cyclone prediction in the country is due
                        to this data being available to IMD.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Arctic mooring program was initiated and continued for establishing link between Arctic and
                        Indian monsoon. Later ambient noise measurement also was added to the mooring which detects ice
                        cracking noise which is a useful data for climate change studies. </p></li>
                    <li><p>Assessed the sea cage farming potential of the country and carried out a geospatial analysis
                        of Indian seas to identify the prospective areas for marine finfish farming. The analysis
                        revealed the availability of vast technically suitable areas between 5 and 100 m depth zone
                        which is regarded as cost effective mariculture zone. </p></li>
                    <li><p>Biodiesel was produced by base-catalysed transesterification reaction from the oil extracted
                        form Chlorella vulgaris. Test run of biodiesel (B-10) powered vehicle from Nellore to Chennai
                        was successfully completed. </p></li>
                    <li><p>Received United Nations fellowship in 1985-86</p></li>
