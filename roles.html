                        laying
                        artificial nodules on the ocean floor. A Remotely Operated Subsea Artificial Nodule Laying
                        System was developed for creating a small mine site similar to that of the one in Central Indian
                        Ocean Basin (CIOB). Artificial nodules were prepared with properties (density, hardness and
                        aggregate impact test value) close to that of manganese nodules.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>To meet the grand challenges of designing the underwater mining system at a depth of 6000m,
                        it
                        required to develop an underwater in-situ soil property measuring system and Design, implement
                        and test the system in hostile location (at a depth of 5462m in the Central Indian Ocean Basin).
                        The above was successfully designed, fabricated and tested in the Central Indian Ocean basin.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>India’s first Polar Remotely Operable Vehicle (PROV) was developed and tested. The Polar ROV
                        was
                        tested successfully at the Priyadarshini lake at Antarctica. Underwater videos were taken for
                        the first time in the country with this vehicle.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>Played a major role in design and implementation of a work class Remotely Operable Vehicle
                        (ROV)
                        – again first for the country – that can be used for assisting the mining operations, gas

                    <li><p>Brought to rail the Ocean observation buoy system with 12 buoys always available in the
                        Indian
                        seas to collect atmospheric and sub surface data, which gets disseminated to Indian National
                        Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), thereby to Indian Meteorological Department
                        (IMD). One of the reasons for improvement in Cyclone prediction in the country is due to this
                        data being available to IMD.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>Arctic mooring program was initiated and continued for establishing link between Arctic and
                        Indian monsoon. Later ambient noise measurement also was added to the mooring which detects ice
                        cracking noise which is a useful data for climate change studies.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>Assessed the sea cage farming potential of the country and carried out a geospatial analysis
                        of
                        Indian seas to identify the prospective areas for marine finfish farming. The analysis revealed
                        the availability of vast technically suitable areas between 5 and 100 m depth zone which is
                        regarded as cost effective mariculture zone.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>Biodiesel was produced by base-catalysed transesterification reaction from the oil extracted
                        form C. vulgaris. Test run of biodiesel (B-10) powered vehicle from Nellore to Chennai was
                        successfully completed.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>Technology transfer to Industry was done for Remotely Operable Vehicles, wave powered data
